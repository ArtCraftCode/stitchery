# Stitchery

Stitchery is intended to act as a personal sewing pattern library for sewists to keep track of patterns and their requirements for sewing.

It can be deployed to Heroku with little effort, simply fork the repository and deploy using the Heroku command line tools. The only addon required that won't be automatically added to your application is [wwwhisper](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/wwwhisper).

Authentication is provided by Mozilla's [Personas](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/). 

## Upcoming features

- Create "people" and save their sizes
- Assign a variant to an individual person
- Pre-fill popular pattern sizes into the variants form
